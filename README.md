# Example Implementations

A collection of examples that implement, integrate with or otherwise use Toucan's contracts and infrastructure. Some of these may be used in production.

## OffsetHelper

A smart contract that builds on top of the carbon offsetting process offered by Toucan to make it far easier and simpler.

This contract allows users to swap their USDC (or other tokens) for pool tokens (like BCT or NCT) which shall be redeemed for TCO2s which shall be retired... all of this in just one method / call.
